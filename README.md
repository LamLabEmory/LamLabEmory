- 👋  Hi, we're @LamLabEmory
- 👀  We're a group of academic scientists, engineers, and physicians led by Wilbur Lam, MD, PhD who are looking to enable detailed data analysis for the hematology and microfluidics community.
- 🌱  We're currently learning the ins and outs of creating open source software. iCLOTS, a free software created for the analysis of common hematology and/or microfluidic workflow image data, is now available as a pre-release at iCLOTS.org/software.
- 💞️  We're looking to collaborate on creating computational analysis pipelines for hematology and/or microfluidics experimental data, particularly imaging data.
- 📫  Reach our coding team directly at LamLabComputational@gmail.com
